# Bunnies-and-Badgers
//About the project:
It's a real world video game of python made with the help of PyGame module.The player is portrayed as a cute bunny who is set to save her 
little ones and her small castles from the evil badgers who wants to destroy evrything.Player needs help her win over the evil ones by 
shooting and killing thebadgers.Player can even check how good their accuracy was during the course of the game.Its a fun filled game 
packed with melodious music,sound effects,beautiful background.It even contains a health bar to check how much life span of the bunny is
left.
//Directions for use:
The source code is present in the game.py file. Executing it would run the game but before that a few changes are required to be made.
First of all,obviuosly python should be installed(It works on both python and python3.So anyone,if,present, would do).Then the pygame 
module also needs to be intalled before the game can be executed.Secondly,the images and sounds needs to be loaded for the game to work.
For that the path of the images are to be added in the 'Load images' section and similarly the sounds in the audio section.All the images
and sounds are provided as named along with the source code.The files should first be saved in a folder and place the in the same place as
the code(Like I did by putting them seperately in iamgesand audio folders and ultimately in resources folder and kept it in python36 folder
of C drive where my code is also present).Once the file paths are added,executing the python code will run the code and its ready to play.
